Assignments for CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle<br><br>
<b>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?<br></b>
-->I interpret user needs by placing myself in the shoes of the end user and turning their wants and needs into short and easy-to-understand "user stories". In one sentence, I state who the end user is, what feature they are asking for, and what they hope to accomplish with it.<br><br>
<b>How do I approach developing programs?<br> What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?<br></b>
-->One agile process that I will definitely incorporate going forward is breaking my work up into small, manageble chunks. Thinking of each weekly module as a "sprint" might be a good habit for me to develop. <br><br>
<b>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</b><br>
-->A good team member is honest, communicates well, and takes responsiblity for the work that they do. They are not afraid to fail, because failure often means a lesson learned. A good team member is willing to share their knowledge with others.
